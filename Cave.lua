-- HFWM-Forever Cave
--
-- Decides *whether* there is a cave map to show and *which floor* it should
-- be showing; CaveRenderer owns the window that shows it.
--
-- The case this exists for: the player walks into a cave, a mine, a vault —
-- anything the client models as its own UiMapID — and the world map carries
-- on showing the zone above, which has nothing to say about where they now
-- are. When the map the player is standing on differs from the map on screen
-- and is an interior type, the cave window opens over the top.
--
-- Two things are deliberately *not* automatic:
--
--   * A cave the user closed stays closed until they leave it. Re-opening it
--     the moment the poll next runs would make the close button useless, and
--     the suppression is keyed on the map group so that walking between
--     floors of a dungeon the user dismissed does not bring it back.
--   * A floor the user picked on the depth slider stays picked while they are
--     still in the same cave. Floor follow-along is the default, but browsing
--     the level below you is the whole reason the slider is there.

-- Sources
--
-- Everything below this point asks the same handful of questions about an
-- interior — where is the player, which floors does this place have, what art
-- draws them, where does the pin go — and on any given build only one thing
-- can answer them:
--
--   ClientSource   C_Map. Right wherever the client's UiMap table carries
--                  Dungeon and Micro rows, which is every retail build and no
--                  1.x one.
--
--   BakedSource    CaveData.lua, read through ns.CaveTable. The rows this
--                  build's UiMap does not have, rebuilt offline from retail's
--                  map plumbing, validated against this build's own art and
--                  AreaTable, and shipped with the addon. Its floor IDs are
--                  synthetic (4000001 up) and are never handed to a C_Map
--                  function — see CaveTable.lua.
--
-- Both are kept behind one interface so that nothing further down, and nothing
-- in CaveRenderer, has to know which one is talking. C_Map stays preferred
-- where it has anything to say: a client that really does carry interior maps
-- knows more about them than a table baked against a different build, and the
-- day this beta ships those rows the addon should quietly start using them
-- rather than keep drawing from a snapshot.

    ---   map. A micro dungeon has its own coordinate space, and the position
    ---   only lands in it once the player is properly inside; on the threshold
    ---   this still says "the zone".
    ---
    ---   C_Minimap.GetUiMapID reports the map the *minimap* has swapped its
    ---   art to. That swap is the client stating that it now considers the
    ---   player to be in the interior, and it is driven by the map's own
    ---   bounds rather than by a position lookup — so on the way in it is
    ---   usually first.
